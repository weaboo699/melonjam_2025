Long, long ago, in the shadow of these great mountains...[w]
There lived a group of ancient spirits.[w]
They had no bodies, no faces, only eternal longing.[w]
They envied everything humans possessed—[w]
Warm bodies, beating hearts, unique faces.[w]
Especially faces.[w]
To the spirits, a face represented proof of "existence."[w]
And they had nothing.[w]
So jealousy grew in their hearts, transforming into a curse...[w]
They would seek out those who were "complete"—[w]
Those who possessed talent, possessed identity, possessed a certain sense of self.[w]
Then, on some unsuspecting morning...[w]
They would steal their faces.[w]
The village elders say this is the spirits' revenge.[w]
But some wise ones whisper...[w]
This might be, perhaps, a cruel gift.[w]

Another new day. Today I need to finish that batch of...[w]
What are you...?[w]
No, that's not right... this can't be...[w]
But I'm... I'm right here! Why...[w]
...The spirits. You did this, didn't you?[w]
You finally... took what you wanted.[w]
Without a face... I'm nothing.[w]
What will the villagers think of me? A... monster? Someone cursed?[w]
What should I do...[w]

<color=purple>Pardon the intrusion.</color>[w]
...Who are you?[w]
Don't come closer! I... I look like this now...[w]
<color=purple>All I see is a craftsperson.</color>[w]
Craftsperson...? Can't you see? I have no face![w]
<color=purple>A face... what is that?</color>[w]
<color=purple>Is it the reflection in a mirror? Or the works your hands create?</color>[w]
<color=purple>Is it how others see you? Or how you see yourself?</color>[w]
<color=purple>I don't understand what you're saying...</color>[w]
<color=purple>Look.</color>[w]
<color=purple>This clay pot, before it's finished, what is it?</color>[w]
...It's clay.[w]
<color=purple>And in your hands, clay can become anything.</color>[w]
<color=purple>Losing one face doesn't mean losing yourself.</color>[w]
<color=purple>Perhaps... this is a chance to rediscover who you are.</color>[w]
Rediscover...?[w]
<color=purple>You are a craftsperson. Your hands can bring life from clay.</color>[w]
<color=purple>If the mirror no longer reflects you... then you can shape it yourself.</color>[w]
You mean... create a face?[w]
<color=purple>Why only one?</color>[w]
Wait! You...[w]
