Finally... it's complete.[w]
<color=orange>Stand up.</color>[w]
Who?! Who's speaking?[w]
<color=orange>You know what to do.</color>[w]
This voice... is it from the mask...?[w]
[image,char2,courage,400,0,1,spFadeIn_1000]
<color=orange>Don't be afraid.</color>[w]
I'm not afraid... I'm just...[w]
<color=orange>You're trembling.</color>[w]
...Yes. I'm scared.[w]
Scared the villagers will see me, scared to walk through that door, scared to face the world outside...[w]
<color=orange>Then you need me even more.</color>[w]
You... who are you?[w]
<color=orange>You created me, yet you don't recognize me?</color>[w]
Courage... so you are courage?[w]
<color=orange>I am the courage you need. The courage you've always had.</color>[w]
Always had...?[w]
<color=orange>Where do you think the determination to create me came from?</color>[w]
<color=orange>Where do you think the strength to stand up in despair came from?</color>[w]
...From myself?[w]
<color=orange>Always.</color>[w]
<color=orange>I only help you see—what you've always had.</color>[w]
I see...[w]
I always thought... losing my face meant losing everything.[w]
But these things—courage, determination, strength...[w]
They were never in my face, were they?[w]
<color=orange>They're here.</color>[w]
Thank you.[w]
<color=orange>Don't thank me. This is a gift you gave yourself.</color>[w]
There are other masks... aren't there?[w]
Other parts of myself... I haven't discovered yet.[w]
Then I need to keep searching.[w]
