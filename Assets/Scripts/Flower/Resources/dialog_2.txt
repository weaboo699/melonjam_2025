This time... it shouldn't startle me again, right?[w]
[image,char2,winstom,400,0,1,spFadeIn_1000]
<color=cyan>Do you hear it?</color>[w]
...Yes. I hear it.[w]
Wind, water, trees... all the sounds.[w]
<color=cyan>They've always been speaking. You're only hearing them now.</color>[w]
Last time Courage told me... you're all part of myself.[w]
<color=cyan>You learn quickly.</color>[w]
So wisdom has always been in my heart too?[w]
<color=cyan>Since you first touched clay.</color>[w]
<color=cyan>Since you understood the relationship between heat and time.</color>[w]
<color=cyan>Since you learned to wait for pottery to dry naturally, rather than forcing it.</color>[w]
I thought... wisdom was reading many books, knowing many things.[w]
<color=cyan>That's just knowledge.</color>[w]
<color=cyan>Wisdom is understanding—understanding how things work, why they are, and the connections between them.</color>[w]
Like understanding clay needs water, but too much will make it collapse...[w]
<color=cyan>Like understanding that losing one face can also mean gaining countless faces.</color>[w]
...So the spirits taking my reflection...[w]
Wasn't punishment, but...?[w]
<color=cyan>It was a question.</color>[w]
<color=cyan>If you're not the face in the mirror—then who are you?</color>[w]
I don't know the complete answer yet.[w]
<color=cyan>Then keep searching.</color>[w]
<color=cyan>Each mask will tell you a part.</color>[w]
Courage taught me not to be afraid, wisdom taught me to understand...[w]
So what comes next?[w]
What else do I need to see?[w]
