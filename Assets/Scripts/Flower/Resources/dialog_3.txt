<color=yellow>Do you feel it?</color>[w]
...So much. Too much.[w]
The injured bird outside, the lonely spider in the corner...[w]
Even these pottery pieces—they long to be completed, to be used...[w]
<color=yellow>Every being has its own pain and longing.</color>[w]
This feeling... it's so heavy.[w]
I can feel all the hurt, all the loneliness...[w]
<color=yellow>This is compassion—bearing it together with others.</color>[w]

<color=yellow>You don't need to bear all pain alone.</color>[w]
<color=yellow>You only need to see it, understand it, and then...</color>[w]
Then?[w]
<color=yellow>Do what you can.</color>[w]
...I can help it.[w]
I can give it warmth, food, a safe place.[w]
<color=yellow>That's enough.</color>[w]
<color=yellow>Compassion isn't saving everyone—that's arrogance.</color>[w]
<color=yellow>Compassion is offering tenderness within your reach.</color>[w]
Courage helped me overcome fear, wisdom helped me understand...[w]

<color=yellow>Care for yourself, and care for others.</color>[w]
Three masks now...[w]
I feel myself becoming more complete, but...[w]
