Courage, wisdom, compassion[w]
I've finally found them all.[w]
Strange... I thought my reflection would return once I gathered all the masks.[w]
But now... I don't think I need it anymore.[w]
<color=purple>You finally understand.</color>[w]
It's you...[w]
[image,char2,spirit,400,0,1,spFadeIn_1000]
You knew all along, didn't you?[w]
<color=purple>Knew what?</color>[w]
The spirits never meant to harm me.[w]
Taking my reflection... was to make me see—[w]
I was never just that one face in the mirror.[w]
<color=purple>You learn quickly.</color>[w]
...You are those spirits?[w]
<color=purple>We're sorry for all the pain you had to go through.</color>[w]
No... I should thank you.[w]
If I hadn't lost my reflection, I never would have started this journey.[w]
I would have always thought I was just 'Kira, the craftsperson.'[w]
But now I know—I can be brave Kira, wise Kira, compassionate Kira...[w]
<color=purple>Identity is not a cage, but an endless, beautiful transformation.</color>[w]
Yes. I finally understand.[w]
<color=purple>Our mission is complete.</color>[w]
<color=purple>Farewell, Kira. May your masks inspire many more.</color>[w]
Wait—you're leaving?[w]
<color=purple>We've always been here.</color>[w]
<color=purple>In every moment you choose your own face.</color>[w]
[remove,char2,spFadeOut_1000]
...[w]
Then, it's time to get to work.[w]
<color=green>Excuse me... is anyone here?</color>[w]
<color=green>I heard there's a craftsperson here... who makes special masks?</color>[w]
Yes. Please come in.[w]
Tell me... what kind of yourself do you want to become?[w]
